# STEMFEM - Female STEM Graduation Prediction

## Mission & Problem Statement
Gender disparity in STEM education remains a global challenge with female graduation rates varying significantly across countries and fields. This project addresses the need for data-driven insights into female STEM participation by developing a machine learning model that predicts female graduation rates based on historical data, enrollment patterns, and gender gap indices. The solution provides policymakers and educators with actionable predictions to improve gender equality in STEM education.
